This is the weather forecast app, made in ReactJS.

- It uses Dark Sky's API to get the actual weather data and forecast.
- It displays the current weather data on home page, and a seven day forecast which is displayed in day-cards row.
- By clicking on any of day-cards, it displays a new page with detailed forecast including the hour forecast for the day that you've clicked on.
- The app can be refreshed on any of the pages, and it will not show 404 error. You can even change the URL string, and it will still work properly, with custom messages displaying.
